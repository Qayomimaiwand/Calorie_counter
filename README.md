# Calorie_counter
The "Calorie Counter" project is a Python master's course final project that focuses on creating a calorie tracking application.
It enables the display of a menu by reading data from a JSON file, facilitating effortless menu updates.
In addition, I would like to express gratitude to Mr. Sam Onaisi for his valuable instruction throughout the course.
